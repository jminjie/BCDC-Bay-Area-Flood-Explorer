The ART Bay Area consequence maps and analyses provide a regional scale illustration of potential consequences of coastal flooding due to specific sea level rise and storm surge scenarios, and are intended to improve sea level rise awareness and preparedness. The maps are not detailed to the parcel scale and should not be used for navigation, permitting, regulation, project review, mitigation, actuarial estimations, or other legal uses. Flooding due to sea level rise and storm surges is possible in areas outside of those predicted in these maps, and the maps do not guarantee the safety of an individual or structure. While the maps use the best data available at its time of publication to capture topographic features (e.g., berms, tide gates), they may not capture other infrastructure improvements (e.g., pumps) designed to reduce future flood extent. The maps do not model flooding and impacts from other sources, such as riverine, groundwater, or surface water flooding from rainfall runoff events, nor do they model erosion, subsidence, or local wind and wave effects.
