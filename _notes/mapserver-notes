MAPSERVER
==============================================================================================================
    Mapserver: /var/www/mapserver.adaptingtorisingtides.org
    
    Inundation Rasters:  /bcdc-data/inundrasts
    Connection Scripts:  /bcdc-data/dbconns
    
    MapServer is accessed in browser via: https://mapserver.adaptingtorisingtides.org/cgi-bin/mapserv
    
    Map path can be set in configs. By default, location to main/production is located in 
    /opt/slrviewer/mapfiles/ which is the "parent" repo. You can point staging/dev to the forked repos in
    /opt/bayareaviewer/mapfiles/ for example, to test mapfiles changes without affecting prod. Eventually 
    though, changes in child/forked repos will have to be propagated into the parent repo to affect the prod 
    mapfile location.
    
    Script alias setup to cgi-bin scripts (at `/usr/lib/cgi-bin`) with a symlink therein to mapserv binary. 
    This allows accessing MapServer from web. 
        See: http://www.mapserver.org/installation/unix.html#installation
        
    NOTE: With current setup as subdomains under adaptingtorisingtides.org, CORS is not necessary. However, if
    setup ever changes to differing main URLs, MapServer site will need CORS enabled.
        See: https://enable-cors.org/server_apache.html
    
    NOTE: As currently setup, MapServer uses local_config.map which always connects to production. There is 
    not, as of yet, a clean way of connecting to development except manually setting up the connection file in
    the mapfile for said layer.

MAPCACHE
==============================================================================================================
    MapCache Location:     /bcdc-data/tiles
    MapCache Config File:  /opt/slrviewer/mapfiles/mapcache_config.xml
       -SYMLINKED BY:      /bcdc-data/tiles/mapcache_config.xml
    
    MapCache is accessed in browser via:  https://mapserver.adaptingtorisingtides.org/mapcache
    
    MapCache config must be pointed to in Apache site config.
        See: http://mapserver.org/mapcache/install.html#apache-module-specific-instructions
    
    Adding layers to MapCache should be fairly self-explanatory when looking at the mapcache config file. Note
    the various hard-coded paths to the mapserver URL and main mapfile. These must be kept up to date.
    
    Seeding tiles is done by the following command (broken into multiple lines for readability but should be 
    single command):
    
        mapcache_seed -c /bcdc-data/tiles/mapcache_config.xml 
                      -t overtopping12cache 
                      -e -13692297.37,4439106.79,-13469658.39,4650301.84 
                      -z 9,17
    
    Adjust -c if mapcache config file location has changed. Adjust -t for tile layer. Given properties for -e 
    and -z limit extend and zoom respectively to same constricted extent and zoom for the application. This 
    doesn't restrict the tileset entirely to though parameters, but simply limits the pre-seeding.
    
    Note `sudo` is likely needed to run mapcache_seed command. So after seeding, ensure you recursive change 
    ownership of all tiles and tile directories back to www-data as it will likely create several things under
    root ownership.
    
        sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /bcdc-data/tiles
